	A note on the Multiverse

	As our universe exists (as far as we know) forever in every conceivable dimension, so does the Multiverse in its inconceivable dimensions.  We observe our universe from what may well be considered a single point about 8,000 miles wide--barring a few tiny dust motes that we call satellites, which beep and blink their systematic and errant observations from places that our Sun’s light can still feebly reach.  
	Our universe exists within the multiverse in a manner that our minds can’t comprehend.  Many of the questions of the multiverse can be answered simply by saying “all of the above and none all the same.”  As beings that are wakeful in three dimensions, whose brains see only two and lie about the third, we can’t begin to visualize a fourth dimension, and as such our understanding of the multiverse can eventually be broken down to gibberish and frantic pawings in the air.  
	Several facts can be certain, though:
	The multiverse links many worlds together;
	The multiverse is nearly impossible to cross; 
	There are beings that can traverse the multiverse;
	That there is what the ancients universally knew in their respective languages as “Beyond.”  This almost certainly describes a distant point in the multiverse far from any known worlds, even those of discredited myths.  Beyond, when spoken of, is altogether revered, dreaded, and desired.  The long lost myths that make any mention of it reference men either leaving forever to Beyond, without trace, or banished beings sent to the homeworld, never to return to Beyond.  A lesser theory on Beyond, for those who have so much as dared to ponder it, is that it simply transcends the scope of the multiverse, that eventually the multiverse might be exited like an atmosphere and that Beyond is like deep space.  None of these theories are actively discussed, because of the dread of Beyond and that no one can even begin to understand the multiverse itself.
