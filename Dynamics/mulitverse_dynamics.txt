These are the dynamics of the multiverse as demonstrated in Scrypt.

Multiverse Plane - a two sided, 2D plane on which worlds are fixed. See
"multiverse_plane_1.png".

World - a universe represented by a line on a multiverse plane that can be
inhabited. A, B, C, and D in "multiverse_plane_1.png" are each worlds.

Inverse World - a world that is on the opposite side of the multiverse plane
from its counterpart.

World Intersection - a point on a multiverse plane at which two world lines
meet. AC, AD, BC, and BD in "multiverse_plane_1.png" are world
intersections.
